**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**
This Development Plan details the processes, standards, and tools to be used by the CodeRelic development team. Its purpose is to establish a consistent and efficient development lifecycle, fostering collaboration, ensuring code quality, and aligning development efforts with project goals defined in the PRS and the technical approach outlined in the TDD.

**1.2 Scope**
This plan covers all aspects of the software development lifecycle for CodeRelic, from initial coding to artifact creation and versioning. It includes methodology, source code management, coding standards, build processes, testing integration (from a development perspective), dependency management, environment strategy, and artifact management. It does not replace detailed testing or release plans but defines how development activities integrate with them.

**1.3 Audience**
This document is intended for all members of the CodeRelic development team (Software Engineers, AI/ML Engineers), Technical Leads, Architects, DevOps Engineers, QA Engineers, and Project Managers involved in the project.

**2. Development Methodology**

**2.1 Agile/Scrum Framework**
CodeRelic development will follow the Agile/Scrum framework to accommodate iterative development, manage complexity, and respond effectively to feedback or changing requirements within the scope defined by the PRS.
*   **Sprint Length:** [TBD, e.g., 2 weeks]
*   **Sprint Goal:** Each sprint will aim to deliver a potentially shippable increment of functionality, focusing on specific features or microservices.

**2.2 Roles and Responsibilities**
*   **Product Owner:** Responsible for managing the product backlog, prioritizing features based on stakeholder input, and defining acceptance criteria.
*   **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and ensures the team adheres to Agile principles.
*   **Development Team:** Cross-functional team (Backend, Frontend, AI/ML, potentially QA embedded) responsible for designing, implementing, testing, and delivering the software increment each sprint. The team is self-organizing regarding how work is performed.

**2.3 Ceremonies**
Standard Scrum ceremonies will be observed:
*   **Sprint Planning:** To select and plan work for the upcoming sprint.
*   **Daily Scrum:** Brief daily meeting to synchronize activities and identify blockers.
*   **Sprint Review:** To demonstrate the sprint increment to stakeholders and gather feedback.
*   **Sprint Retrospective:** To reflect on the previous sprint and identify process improvements.

**2.4 Backlog Management**
*   **Product Backlog:** Maintained by the Product Owner, containing prioritized user stories, features, bug fixes, and technical tasks derived from the PRS.
*   **Sprint Backlog:** Selected items from the Product Backlog that the Development Team commits to completing in a sprint.
*   **Tool:** [TBD, e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps Boards, GitLab Issues] will be used for backlog management and sprint tracking.

**3. Source Code Management**

**3.1 Version Control System (VCS)**
*   **Tool:** Git will be the exclusive VCS for all CodeRelic source code.
*   **Platform:** [TBD, e.g., GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket] will host the Git repositories.

**3.2 Repository Structure**
*   **Approach:** A **Multi-repository** structure will be adopted. Each microservice (e.g., `project-management-service`, `parsing-service-rust`, `frontend-ui`) will reside in its own dedicated Git repository.
*   **Rationale:** Simplifies build pipelines per service, allows independent versioning and deployment cycles, better accommodates the diverse technology stack. Requires good cross-repo coordination for integration.

**3.3 Branching Strategy**
*   **Model:** **Gitflow** (or a simplified variant like GitHub Flow) will be used. Key branches include:
    *   `main`: Represents the latest production-ready code. Tagged for releases. Protected branch. Merges only from `release` or `hotfix` branches.
    *   `develop`: Represents the latest integrated development state. Feature branches merge into `develop`. Protected branch. Code here should always build and pass basic tests.
    *   `feature/<feature-name>`: Branched from `develop` for new feature development. Merged back into `develop` via Pull/Merge Requests.
    *   `bugfix/<issue-id>`: Branched from `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes) to fix bugs. Merged back into `develop` (or `main` and `develop` for hotfixes).
    *   `release/<version>`: Branched from `develop` when preparing for a release. Used for final testing, bug fixing, and documentation updates. Merged into `main` and `develop` upon release.
    *   `hotfix/<issue-id>`: Branched from `main` to address critical production bugs. Merged back into `main` and `develop`.

**3.4 Commit Guidelines**
*   Commits should be atomic, representing a single logical change.
*   Commit messages should follow a standard format (e.g., Conventional Commits: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`) to facilitate automated changelog generation and clear history. Examples: `feat(parser): Add initial COBOL parser structure`, `fix(api): Correct validation logic for project creation`.

**4. Code Review Process**

**4.1 Tooling**
*   Code reviews will be conducted using the Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR) features of the chosen Git hosting platform.

**4.2 Workflow**
1.  Developer completes work on a `feature` or `bugfix` branch.
2.  Developer ensures code builds, passes all automated checks (linting, unit tests) locally.
3.  Developer pushes the branch and creates a PR/MR targeting the appropriate branch (usually `develop`).
4.  CI pipeline runs automatically on the PR/MR. All checks must pass.
5.  Developer assigns reviewers (minimum [TBD, e.g., 1 or 2] required approvals).
6.  Reviewers provide feedback; Developer addresses comments and pushes updates.
7.  Once approved and all checks pass, the PR/MR is merged by the developer or a designated lead.
8.  The source branch is typically deleted after merge.

**4.3 Reviewer Expectations**
Reviewers should focus on:
*   **Correctness:** Does the code meet the requirements/acceptance criteria? Does it handle edge cases?
*   **Maintainability:** Is the code clear, readable, well-documented (where necessary), and easy to modify?
*   **Standards Compliance:** Does the code adhere to established coding standards and patterns?
*   **Testing:** Are there adequate unit tests? Do they cover the changes?
*   **Security:** Are there any obvious security vulnerabilities introduced? (Leverage automated tools first).
*   **Performance:** Are there any apparent performance bottlenecks?
*   **Feedback:** Provide constructive, actionable feedback promptly.

**5. Coding Standards**

**5.1 General Principles**
*   **Readability:** Write clear, understandable code. Follow the principle of least surprise.
*   **Maintainability:** Structure code logically, use meaningful names, avoid overly complex constructs.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid unnecessary code duplication.
*   **Comments:** Use comments to explain *why* something is done (the intent), not *what* the code does (which should be self-evident). Document public APIs/functions thoroughly.

**5.2 Language-Specific Standards**
*   **Python:** Adhere strictly to **PEP 8**. Use **Black** for automated formatting and **Flake8** or **Ruff** for linting. Follow standard Python idioms.
*   **Go:** Adhere strictly to `gofmt` formatting. Use `go vet` and `golint` (or successors like `staticcheck`) for linting. Follow Effective Go guidelines.
*   **Rust:** Adhere strictly to `rustfmt` formatting. Use **Clippy** for comprehensive linting. Follow standard Rust idioms and leverage the type system for safety.
*   **TypeScript/React:** Use **Prettier** for automated formatting. Use **ESLint** with a standard configuration (e.g., combination of `eslint:recommended`, React recommended, TypeScript recommended, potentially Airbnb style guide) for linting.

**5.3 Enforcement**
*   **Automation:** Linters and formatters will be integrated into:
    *   **Pre-commit Hooks:** (Optional, but highly recommended) To check/fix code before committing locally.
    *   **CI Pipeline:** Mandatory checks in the CI pipeline will fail the build if standards are violated.

**6. Build Process**

**6.1 Tools**
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Build Orchestration:** CI server scripts (e.g., `.gitlab-ci.yml`, GitHub Actions workflow files). Makefiles may be used within service repos to standardize common build commands (`make build`, `make test`, `make docker`).
*   **Language Tools:** `pip`/`poetry` (Python), `go build` (Go), `cargo build` (Rust), `npm run build` / `yarn build` (TypeScript/React).

**6.2 Build Steps per Service Type (Illustrative)**
*   **Backend Service (Python/Go/Rust):**
    1.  Install dependencies.
    2.  Run linters/formatters.
    3.  Run unit tests.
    4.  Compile code (Go/Rust).
    5.  Package application (if necessary).
    6.  Build Docker image (using multi-stage Dockerfile).
*   **Frontend Service (React/TypeScript):**
    1.  Install dependencies (`npm ci` / `yarn install`).
    2.  Run linters/formatters.
    3.  Run unit tests.
    4.  Build static assets (`npm run build`).
    5.  Build Docker image (typically serving static assets via a web server like Nginx).

**7. Continuous Integration (CI)**

**7.1 CI Server/Platform**
*   **Platform:** [TBD: GitLab CI or GitHub Actions] based on the chosen Git hosting platform.

**7.2 Pipeline Triggers**
*   On push to any `feature/*` or `bugfix/*` branch.
*   On push/merge to `develop` and `main`.
*   On creation of Pull Requests / Merge Requests.

**7.3 Common Pipeline Stages (Executed per service repository)**
1.  **Setup:** Check out code, configure environment.
2.  **Lint & Format:** Run linters and format checkers (fail if errors).
3.  **Unit Test:** Execute unit tests (fail if tests fail, collect coverage reports).
4.  **Security Scan:**
    *   Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy, Snyk) (NFR-SEC-005).
    *   (Optional) Run Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools if available/configured.
5.  **Build:** Compile code and/or build application artifacts.
6.  **Docker Build:** Build the service's Docker image.
7.  **Docker Scan:** Scan the built Docker image for OS vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy).
8.  **Push to Registry:** (Conditional) Push tagged Docker image to the registry (e.g., on merges to `develop`/`main`, or for tagged releases).
9.  **Deploy:** (Conditional) Automatically deploy to `dev` environment on merge to `develop` branch. Deployments to `qa`/`staging` triggered manually or from release branches/tags.

**7.4 Integration Testing Pipeline**
*   A separate pipeline, triggered after successful deployment of relevant services to the `dev` or `qa` environment.
*   Runs tests that verify interactions between multiple microservices.

**8. Dependency Management**

**8.1 Package Management**
*   Standard tools for each language will be used:
    *   Python: `pip` with `requirements.txt` or preferably `Poetry` (`pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`).
    *   Go: Go Modules (`go.mod`, `go.sum`).
    *   Rust: Cargo (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`).
    *   TypeScript/JS: `npm` (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`) or `yarn` (`package.json`, `yarn.lock`).
*   Lock files MUST be committed to the repository to ensure reproducible builds.

**8.2 Vulnerability Scanning**
*   Automated vulnerability scanning of third-party libraries and base Docker images is mandatory within the CI pipeline (NFR-SEC-005).
*   **Policy:** A clear policy for addressing vulnerabilities will be established ([TBD: e.g., Fail build on Critical/High severity; Medium/Low require review and potential issue creation]).

**8.3 License Compliance**
*   Developers must be mindful of third-party library licenses.
*   Automated tools ([TBD: e.g., FOSSA, Snyk License Compliance]) may be integrated into CI to check for license compatibility against defined policies (OR-LIC-002).
*   A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) will be generated during the build/release process.

**8.4 Dependency Updates**
*   Regular review and update of dependencies are necessary to incorporate security patches and bug fixes.
*   Tools like Dependabot (GitHub) or Renovate Bot can be used to automate the creation of PRs for dependency updates. These updates must go through the standard testing and review process.

**9. Environment Strategy**

**9.1 Local Development Environment**
*   Developers should be able to run the specific service(s) they are working on locally.
*   Options:
    *   Directly on host machine (requires managing language versions/dependencies).
    *   Using Docker Compose to orchestrate the service and its direct dependencies (e.g., local DB, MQ).
    *   Tools like Tilt or Skaffold can facilitate faster development iteration within a local Kubernetes-like environment (Minikube, Kind, Docker Desktop K8s).
*   Mocking or connecting to shared `dev` instances for external service dependencies might be necessary.

**9.2 Shared Development/Integration Environment (`dev`)**
*   **Purpose:** Early integration testing, running automated integration tests.
*   **Infrastructure:** Dedicated Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Deployment:** Automatically deployed from the `develop` branch via CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Data:** May use volatile data stores or be reset frequently. Not stable for formal QA.

**9.3 Testing/QA Environment (`qa`)**
*   **Purpose:** Formal testing cycles (System Testing, Functional Equivalence Testing, UAT).
*   **Infrastructure:** Dedicated Kubernetes cluster, configured similarly to production (resource limits, external dependencies).
*   **Deployment:** Deployed manually or triggered from `release` branches or specific tags. More stable than `dev`.
*   **Data:** Uses controlled test data sets. May require specific configurations for legacy environment testing.

**9.4 Staging Environment (`staging`) (Optional)**
*   **Purpose:** Pre-production validation, final smoke tests, performance soak tests.
*   **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes cluster mirroring production as closely as possible.
*   **Deployment:** Deployed manually from release candidates or release branches.
*   **Data:** May use sanitized production data snapshots (if feasible and permitted) or production-like generated data.

**9.5 Production Environment (`prod`)**
*   **Purpose:** Live customer usage.
*   **Infrastructure:** Customer-managed on-premise Kubernetes clusters. Deployment variability must be expected.
*   **Deployment:** Performed by customer administrators using the provided Helm chart and Installation Guide.

**10. Artifact Management**

**10.1 Container Image Registry**
*   **Purpose:** Store and distribute CodeRelic Docker images.
*   **Tool:** A private Docker Registry is required ([TBD: e.g., Harbor, GitLab Registry, GitHub Packages, AWS ECR, Google Artifact Registry - depends on infrastructure choices]).
*   **Tagging Strategy:**
    *   Images built from `develop` branch: Tagged with commit SHA and `dev`.
    *   Images built from `main`/`release` branches/tags: Tagged with Git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`), commit SHA, and potentially `latest` (use `latest` with caution).

**10.2 Helm Chart Repository**
*   **Purpose:** Store and distribute the CodeRelic Helm chart for customer deployment.
*   **Tool:** A Helm repository ([TBD: e.g., ChartMuseum, GitLab/GitHub Pages, cloud provider artifact storage]).
*   **Versioning:** Helm chart versions will align with CodeRelic application releases.

**10.3 Versioning Strategy**
*   **Approach:** Semantic Versioning (SemVer - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) will be used for overall CodeRelic releases and corresponding Helm chart versions.
*   Individual microservice versions may follow SemVer or use commit hashes for internal tracking, but the customer-facing release artifact (Helm chart) uses the main SemVer number.
