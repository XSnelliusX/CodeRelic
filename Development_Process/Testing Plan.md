**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**
This Testing Plan outlines the comprehensive strategy for verifying the quality, functionality, performance, security, and reliability of the CodeRelic platform (Version 1.0). It details the scope of testing, methodologies, environments, tools, roles, responsibilities, and deliverables required to ensure CodeRelic meets the requirements specified in the PRS (v1.1) and aligns with the architecture defined in the TDD (v1.0). A primary focus is placed on strategies to validate the functional equivalence of the code generated by CodeRelic.

**1.2 Scope of Testing**
**In Scope:**
*   Testing of the CodeRelic application itself, including all microservices, the frontend UI, and the API Gateway.
*   Verification of all functional requirements (FR-*) defined in PRS v1.1.
*   Validation of non-functional requirements (NFR-*), including performance, scalability, security, reliability, and usability.
*   Testing of the installation, configuration, and upgrade processes (via Helm chart).
*   **Crucially:** Testing the *output* of CodeRelic â€“ the translated/modernized code. This includes:
    *   Verification of generated code syntax, style, and structure against configured standards.
    *   Validation of generated documentation and comments.
    *   Execution of generated test stubs.
    *   **Functional equivalence validation** using differential testing and integration with legacy test suites where possible.
*   Testing across supported language pairs (COBOL -> Py/Go; Perl -> TS/Py; Py2 -> Py3).
*   Testing of integrations with external systems: Git repositories, Message Queue, Database, Object Storage, configured LLM endpoints.

**Out of Scope:**
*   Testing the underlying Kubernetes cluster, OS, database, message queue, or object storage infrastructure beyond ensuring CodeRelic interacts correctly with them.
*   Exhaustive testing of every possible construct in the legacy source languages. Testing will focus on common patterns, critical constructs, and representative code samples.
*   Providing or configuring the specific legacy execution environments (e.g., mainframe emulators, specific interpreter versions) required for differential testing; this remains the customer's responsibility, although CodeRelic must provide the framework to *use* these configured environments.
*   Guaranteeing 100% functional equivalence through automated testing alone; testing aims to provide high confidence and significantly aid mandatory human review.
*   Formal linguistic quality assessment of generated documentation (beyond checking presence and basic relevance).

**1.3 Quality Goals**
The primary quality goals for CodeRelic, derived from the PRS and TDD, are:
*   **Functional Correctness:** The system performs all specified functions accurately as per the PRS.
*   **Functional Equivalence (Output):** Translated code behaves identically to the original code for defined inputs and equivalence criteria (FR-FEQ-*).
*   **Reliability:** The system operates stably and recovers gracefully from transient errors (NFR-REL-*).
*   **Performance:** The system meets defined responsiveness and processing throughput targets (NFR-PERF-*).
*   **Scalability:** The system can handle the specified load and scales horizontally (NFR-SCAL-*).
*   **Security:** The system adheres to security best practices, protects customer code, and meets specified security requirements (NFR-SEC-*, CST-*).
*   **Usability:** The system is intuitive and efficient for target users (NFR-USAB-*).
*   **Maintainability:** The system design and codebase facilitate future development and maintenance (verified implicitly through development process, code reviews, and testability).
*   **Portability:** The system installs and runs correctly on target Kubernetes environments (NFR-PORT-*).

**2. Test Strategy**

**2.1 Testing Levels**
Testing will be performed at multiple levels corresponding to the microservice architecture:
*   **Unit Testing:**
    *   *Purpose:* Verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, or classes within a single microservice in isolation.
    *   *Scope:* Focus on logic, algorithms, boundary conditions, error handling within a code unit.
    *   *Responsibility:* Developers, as part of the development process (TDD methodology encouraged).
    *   *Tools:* Language-specific frameworks (e.g., `pytest` for Python, `go test` for Go, `cargo test` for Rust, `Jest`/`Mocha` for TypeScript/React).
    *   *Automation:* Fully automated, run frequently (locally and in CI). Coverage target: [e.g., >75% Branch Coverage] for core logic (NFR-MAIN-003).
*   **Integration Testing:**
    *   *Purpose:* Verify the interaction and communication between different microservices or between a microservice and external dependencies (DB, MQ, Object Storage, external APIs).
    *   *Scope:* Focus on API contracts, message formats (MQ), database interactions, data consistency across services.
    *   *Responsibility:* Developers and QA Engineers.
    *   *Tools:* Testing frameworks combined with HTTP clients, MQ clients, DB clients (e.g., `pytest` with `requests` and `pika`, Go test suites). Tests run against deployed services in the `dev` environment.
    *   *Automation:* Primarily automated, run in CI after deployment to `dev`.
*   **Component Testing:**
    *   *Purpose:* Test the functionality of a single microservice end-to-end via its external API, mocking its direct dependencies.
    *   *Scope:* Validates the service's contract and behavior in isolation.
    *   *Responsibility:* Developers and QA Engineers.
    *   *Tools:* Similar to Integration Testing, but using mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`, `WireMock`).
    *   *Automation:* Primarily automated, run in CI.
*   **System Testing:**
    *   *Purpose:* Verify the behavior of the entire integrated system performing end-to-end workflows, typically initiated via the UI or public API.
    *   *Scope:* Testing user scenarios derived from PRS use cases (e.g., creating a project, ingesting code, running translation, reviewing diff, exporting). Tests both success paths and error conditions.
    *   *Responsibility:* QA Engineers.
    *   *Tools:* UI Automation frameworks (e.g., Cypress, Playwright), API testing tools (Postman, automated scripts). Run against `qa` or `staging` environments.
    *   *Automation:* Key workflows automated; exploratory testing performed manually.
*   **Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   *Purpose:* Formal validation that the system meets business requirements and user needs, conducted from the end-user perspective.
    *   *Scope:* Based on predefined UAT test cases derived from PRS requirements. May involve Product Owner and key stakeholders.
    *   *Responsibility:* QA Engineers facilitate, Product Owner/Stakeholders execute/approve.
    *   *Environment:* `qa` or `staging`.
    *   *Automation:* Primarily manual execution based on test case descriptions.

**2.2 Testing Types**
Specific types of testing will be employed across different levels:
*   **Functional Testing:** Verifying features against PRS functional requirements (FR-*). Performed at all levels (Unit to System).
*   **UI Testing:** Testing the graphical user interface for correctness, layout across browsers (FR-UI-001), responsiveness, and usability (NFR-USAB-*). Primarily System Testing level.
*   **API Testing:** Direct testing of the REST API exposed by the API Gateway, covering functionality, security (authn/authz), error handling, and contract adherence. Component and Integration levels.
*   **Performance & Load Testing:** Assessing system behavior under expected and peak load conditions (NFR-PERF-*, NFR-SCAL-*). Measuring response times, throughput, resource utilization. Requires dedicated test runs in `qa` or `staging` using tools like k6, Locust, or JMeter.
*   **Security Testing:** Validating security requirements (NFR-SEC-*). Includes:
    *   *Dependency Scanning:* Automated in CI (NFR-SEC-005).
    *   *Container Image Scanning:* Automated in CI (NFR-SEC-006).
    *   *Static Application Security Testing (SAST):* Optional automated tools integrated into CI.
    *   *Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):* Automated scanning of running application in `qa`/`staging`.
    *   *Penetration Testing:* Planned manual/automated exercise simulating attacks against `qa`/`staging`.
*   **Usability Testing:** Assessing ease of use, clarity, and workflow efficiency (NFR-USAB-*). Can involve heuristic evaluations, user observation sessions, or feedback surveys.
*   **Installation Testing:** Verifying deployment using the Helm chart on supported Kubernetes versions/distributions (NFR-PORT-*). Testing fresh installs, upgrades, and uninstalls.
*   **Regression Testing:** Re-executing a subset of tests after code changes or bug fixes to ensure no unintended side effects were introduced. Relies heavily on automated test suites (Unit, Integration, API, key System tests).

**2.3 Functional Equivalence / Differential Testing Strategy (Critical Section)**
Validating the functional equivalence of the *translated code* is paramount (FR-FEQ-*). This involves a multi-faceted approach executed primarily by the Testing & Validation Service:
*   **Goal:** Provide high confidence that the translated code produces the same results/behavior as the original legacy code for a given set of inputs.
*   **Core Mechanism: Differential Testing:**
    1.  **Setup:** The user configures a CodeRelic project, including source/target languages and provides the legacy codebase.
    2.  **Environment Configuration (User Responsibility - FR-FEQ-005.1):** The user configures the Testing & Validation Service with details on how to execute *both* the original legacy code and the translated modern code. This includes:
        *   Specifying container images, interpreters, emulators (e.g., Hercules for COBOL, specific Perl version), or execution commands.
        *   Providing necessary dependencies or setup scripts for both environments.
        *   Defining paths or connection details for required resources (e.g., test databases, input/output file locations).
    3.  **Input Definition:** The user provides or configures input data sets (e.g., files, database entries, API call parameters). CodeRelic may offer basic generation techniques (e.g., fuzzing) as an advanced option.
    4.  **Execution Orchestration (CodeRelic Responsibility):** The Testing & Validation Service uses the configuration to:
        *   Spin up temporary, isolated execution environments (e.g., K8s pods) for both legacy and translated code.
        *   Execute both versions with the identical input set.
        *   Capture specified outputs (e.g., stdout, stderr, generated files, database state changes [via pre/post snapshots or query results], network responses).
    5.  **Output Comparison (CodeRelic Responsibility):** The service compares the captured outputs based on user-defined rules and *tolerances* (e.g., exact match for strings, configurable precision for floats, specific fields in JSON/XML, ignore timestamps).
    6.  **Reporting:** Results are reported as Pass (outputs match within tolerance), Fail (mismatched outputs), or Indeterminate (execution failed, setup error). Detailed logs and diffs of mismatches are provided.
*   **Leveraging Existing Tests (FR-FEQ-003):** If the legacy system has existing test suites, CodeRelic will provide mechanisms to integrate them into the validation process. The user configures how to run these legacy tests against the original code and CodeRelic attempts to adapt/run them against the translated code (may require manual adaptation). Results are reported.
*   **Generated Test Stubs (FR-TEST-*):** While not verifying equivalence directly, executing the generated unit test stubs confirms the translated code can be compiled/run and provides a basic sanity check. These are executed as part of the validation stage.
*   **Static Analysis on Output (FR-FEQ-006):** Running configured linters/formatters on the translated code ensures it meets basic quality/style standards. Integration with SAST tools adds a layer of security checking.
*   **Human Review:** Automated equivalence testing *aids* but does not *replace* mandatory human review. CodeRelic's diff views (FR-DIFF-*) and validation reports are crucial inputs for directing developers' attention to critical or flagged sections.

**2.4 Test Automation Approach**
*   **Priority:** Automation is key for efficiency and regression coverage.
*   **Unit Tests:** Fully automated, part of the CI build for each service.
*   **Integration Tests:** Primarily automated, run against `dev` environment in CI.
*   **Component Tests:** Primarily automated, run in CI.
*   **API Tests:** Primarily automated, run against `dev` and `qa` environments.
*   **System Tests (UI):** Key end-to-end workflows automated (using Cypress/Playwright). Manual exploratory testing supplements automation.
*   **Performance Tests:** Scripted using load testing tools.
*   **Installation Tests:** Partially automated scripts verifying Helm deployment and basic checks.
*   **Differential Testing:** Orchestration is automated by CodeRelic; result comparison is automated. Environment setup and input/criteria definition involve manual configuration.
*   **Regression Testing:** Achieved by regularly running the automated suites (Unit, Integration, API, System).

**3. Test Environment**

**3.1 Environment Definitions (`dev`, `qa`, `staging`)**
Referencing Development Plan Section 9:
*   **`dev`:** For early integration testing, running automated integration tests post-merge to `develop`. Unstable, frequently updated.
*   **`qa`:** Primary environment for formal testing cycles (System, Regression, Performance, UAT, Equivalence Validation). Deployed from release branches/tags, more stable. Requires configuration capabilities for legacy environments.
*   **`staging` (Optional):** Mirrors production closely for pre-release validation.

**3.2 Hardware and Software Requirements**
*   Each environment requires a Kubernetes cluster meeting specified versions (NFR-PORT-001).
*   Access to external dependencies: PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ/Kafka, S3-compatible Object Storage (MinIO), configured LLM endpoint(s). Versions should match or be compatible with production recommendations.
*   Sufficient compute, memory, and storage resources allocated to meet performance/scalability NFRs under test conditions.
*   **Crucially for `qa`/`staging`:** Capability to host or connect to the necessary legacy execution environments (e.g., run Docker containers with specific emulators/interpreters) as configured by the user for differential testing. Network connectivity between CodeRelic's Testing service and these environments is required.

**3.3 Test Data Management**
*   A diverse set of representative legacy code samples (COBOL, Perl, Python 2) covering various constructs and complexities is required.
*   Input data sets for functional and differential testing need to be created and managed. This may include sample files, database fixtures, API call parameters.
*   Where production data is used to derive test data, robust sanitization processes must be applied to remove sensitive information (PII/PHI).
*   Mechanisms for resetting environments (especially DB, Object Storage state) between test runs are necessary for repeatable tests.
*   Test data, including code samples and input sets, should be version controlled or managed in a dedicated repository/location.

**4. Test Execution**

**4.1 Test Cycles**
*   **Sprint Testing:** Unit, component, and some integration testing performed within each sprint on completed features.
*   **Integration Test Cycle:** Focused runs of automated integration tests, typically post-deployment to `dev`.
*   **System Test Cycle:** Executed in `qa` environment, covering end-to-end scenarios (manual and automated). Occurs typically when a feature set is ready or during release stabilization.
*   **Regression Test Cycle:** Executed frequently (e.g., nightly in `qa`) or before releases, running the core automated test suites.
*   **Equivalence Validation Cycle:** Specific test runs focused on differential testing using configured legacy code samples and environments in `qa`.
*   **Performance Test Cycle:** Dedicated runs under controlled conditions in `qa`/`staging`.
*   **UAT Cycle:** Planned phase before release involving stakeholders in `qa`/`staging`.
*   **Installation Test Cycle:** Performed when release candidates are available.

**4.2 Entry Criteria (Example for System Test Cycle)**
*   Successful deployment of the target build/release candidate to the `qa` environment.
*   All CI checks (lint, unit tests, component tests) passing for the build.
*   Required test data and environment configurations are in place.
*   Relevant features marked as "Development Complete".
*   Smoke test suite passes.

**4.3 Exit Criteria (Example for System Test Cycle / Pre-Release)**
*   All planned System test cases executed.
*   Test pass rate meets target [e.g., 98%+] for planned test cases.
*   No open Blocker or Critical severity defects.
*   Number of open Major severity defects below agreed threshold [e.g., < 5].
*   Functional equivalence validation passed for critical code samples/workflows.
*   Key performance metrics met.
*   Required documentation (e.g., Release Notes) reviewed.
*   Successful UAT completion (if applicable).

**5. Defect Management**

**5.1 Defect Tracking Tool**
*   [TBD: e.g., Jira] will be used for logging, tracking, and managing all defects found during testing.

**5.2 Defect Lifecycle**
*   **Workflow:** `New` -> `Open` (Triaged & Assigned) -> `In Progress` (Developer working) -> `Resolved` (Developer fixed) -> `Ready for QA` -> `Verified` (QA confirms fix) -> `Closed` OR `Reopened` (If fix invalid). Additional states: `Deferred`, `Rejected`.
