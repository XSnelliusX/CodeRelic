**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**
This Project Requirements Specification (PRS) document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the CodeRelic platform (Version 1.1). CodeRelic is an AI-driven system designed to automate the modernization of legacy codebases. This document serves as the primary input for system design, development, testing, and user documentation efforts. It establishes a formal agreement between stakeholders on what CodeRelic will deliver.

**1.2 Scope**
**In Scope:**

*   The CodeRelic system as a deployable on-premise application.
*   **Optionally, generation of comments and external documentation (e.g., Markdown) describing the *original* legacy code based on AI analysis.**
*   AI-powered translation of source code from specified legacy languages (**initially COBOL, Perl, Python 2**) to specified modern languages (**initially Python 3, Go, TypeScript, Rust**). For a given project, the user selects *one* supported source language and *one or more* supported target languages from this initial set, based on available and defined translation paths (e.g., COBOL -> Python 3).
*   Generation of an Intermediate Representation (IR) capturing code semantics.
*   Emphasis on achieving functional equivalence between original and translated code.
*   Automated generation of contextual comments, docstrings, and potentially external documentation (Markdown) **for the *translated* modern code**.
*   Side-by-side comparison view highlighting differences between original, **(optionally) commented legacy,** and translated code.
*   Specific handling of intra-language upgrades (e.g., Python 2 to 3) based on known migration paths.
*   User customization of translation parameters (style, libraries, formatting).
*   Export of translated code in various formats (modules, containerized services, API specifications), **as well as generated legacy documentation artifacts.**
*   Automated generation of unit test stubs/scaffolding for translated code.
*   Generation of basic CI/CD pipeline configurations (e.g., GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
*   Core processing engine and data storage designed for secure, on-premise deployment.
*   A web-based user interface for managing projects, configuring translations **(including legacy documentation options)**, viewing results, and exporting code.
*   User authentication and role-based access control.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Cloud-hosted (SaaS) version of the core processing engine (by default).
*   Guaranteed 100% perfect, error-free translation requiring no human review. CodeRelic is a powerful assistant, not a full replacement for developer oversight.
*   Translation of languages not explicitly listed as supported in this version.
*   Automated architectural refactoring beyond code-level translation (e.g., automatic monolith-to-microservices decomposition is a future consideration, not V1 scope).
*   Execution or debugging environment for the translated code beyond validation testing.
*   Direct modification or commit of translated code back to the original source repository.
*   Real-time collaborative editing features.
*   Providing the execution environment for all possible legacy languages (Emulators like Hercules may be required for differential testing but are external dependencies to be provided/configured by the customer).

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**
CodeRelic is a self-contained, enterprise software product designed to be deployed entirely within a customer's own infrastructure (on-premise data center or private cloud/VPC). It functions as a specialized code processing and transformation workbench. While it integrates with source code repositories (like Git) for input and can generate artifacts compatible with CI/CD systems, it does not directly manage build, deployment, or runtime environments beyond its own operational needs and the setup required for differential testing. Its primary value lies in securely analyzing, documenting, and translating legacy codebases while aiding developers in the validation and integration process.

**2.2 Product Functions**
CodeRelic provides the following high-level functions:

*   **Project Definition:** Allows users to define modernization projects, specifying source and target languages, linking code repositories, and setting translation and documentation parameters.
*   **Code Analysis:** Ingests, parses, and analyzes legacy source code to understand its structure, semantics, dependencies, and control flow, building a rich Intermediate Representation (IR).
*   **Legacy Code Documentation (Optional):** Generates comments within a copy of the legacy code and external documentation files describing the legacy code's structure and inferred logic based on AI analysis.
*   **AI-Powered Transformation:** Leverages AI/ML techniques and rule-based systems to transform the IR, applying modernization logic, language translation rules, and version-specific upgrades.
*   **Modern Code Generation:** Generates functionally equivalent code in the target modern language, incorporating best practices, comments, and documentation.
*   **Validation Assistance:** Facilitates validation by generating test stubs and providing tools/reports for comparing original and translated code behavior (including differential testing setup).
*   **Reporting & Review:** Offers side-by-side code comparison (including optionally commented legacy code), highlights changes and potential issues, and provides analysis summaries and generated documentation to guide human review.
*   **Customization & Configuration:** Enables users to tailor the translation process (e.g., coding style, library choices, documentation generation options) and manage system settings (e.g., LLM endpoints).
*   **Secure Operation:** Ensures all code processing occurs within the customer's environment, with no source code transmitted externally.

**2.3 User Characteristics**
CodeRelic will be used by various technical roles within an organization:

*   **Software Engineers/Developers:** Primary users performing code translation, reviewing results (including legacy documentation), integrating generated code, and using generated tests. Expected to be proficient in source/target languages and development practices.
*   **Technical Leads/Architects:** Users defining project scope, setting modernization standards via customization, evaluating the feasibility and results of translations and documentation, and overseeing the integration process.
*   **DevOps/Platform Engineers:** Users responsible for deploying, configuring, maintaining, and monitoring the CodeRelic application within the on-premise environment. Proficient in Docker, Kubernetes, and system administration.
*   **Security Teams:** Users involved in vetting the security aspects of the on-premise deployment and ensuring compliance with internal security policies.
*   **System Administrators:** Users responsible for initial setup, user management within CodeRelic, and potentially managing underlying infrastructure resources (storage, compute, DB).

**2.4 Constraints**

*   **CST-01:** The core CodeRelic processing engine MUST be deployable entirely within the customer's network infrastructure (on-premise or private cloud).
*   **CST-02:** Customer source code MUST NOT be transmitted outside the customer's controlled environment during any stage of the analysis or translation process.
*   **CST-03:** The system must rely on containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for deployment and scaling. Specific supported versions (e.g., Kubernetes **[Target Range: v1.21 - v1.27]**, Docker Engine **[Target Range: v20.10+]**) must be defined and documented in the installation guide. Minimum and recommended versions should be specified.
*   **CST-04:** Initial language support is limited to the pairs defined in Scope (Sec 1.2), although the architecture must support extension.
*   **CST-05:** Integration with external LLM APIs is optional; the system MUST support configuration with locally hosted/on-premise LLM endpoints.
*   **CST-06:** Functional equivalence validation, particularly differential testing, requires customer-provided or configured execution environments/emulators for legacy code, which are external to CodeRelic itself.
*   **CST-07:** The system must operate within defined resource limits. Baseline and recommended resource requirements (minimum vCPU, Memory, Storage I/O) for typical deployment sizes will be specified in the Deployment Guide. **[Placeholder Example: Baseline target for processing 100k LOC could be a K8s node with 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM].**

**2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies**

*   **ASU-01:** Customers possess or can provision a suitable Kubernetes cluster meeting the defined prerequisites **(See NFR-PORT-001, NFR-PORT-002)**.
*   **ASU-02:** Customers have access to required external services like a PostgreSQL database, a RabbitMQ/Kafka message broker, and S3-compatible object storage, or can deploy them alongside CodeRelic according to documented specifications.
*   **ASU-03:** Customers can provide network connectivity between CodeRelic services and required internal resources (Git repositories, local LLM endpoints, legacy test environments).
*   **ASU-04:** Customers have personnel with the necessary skills (Kubernetes admin, DevOps) to deploy and manage CodeRelic.
*   **ASU-05:** The legacy codebases provided as input are reasonably complete and syntactically parsable, although error tolerance is required **(See FR-PARSE-005)**.
*   **DEP-01:** CodeRelic depends on various open-source libraries (parsing, ML, web frameworks, etc.). Their licenses must be compatible with CodeRelic's distribution model **(See OR-LIC-002)**.
*   **DEP-02:** CodeRelic depends on the availability and performance of the configured LLM (local or API) for certain features like documentation generation (for both legacy and modern code).
*   **DEP-03:** The accuracy of version-aware modernization depends on the completeness and correctness of the internal knowledge base derived from official migration guides.

*   **FR-LEGACYDOC-003:** If enabled, the system shall generate explanatory comments within a *separate copy* of the original legacy source files. These comments shall adhere to the commenting syntax of the source language (e.g., `*` for COBOL, `#` for Perl/Python 2). The original ingested code shall remain unmodified.
*   **FR-LEGACYDOC-004:** Generated legacy comments shall aim to explain the purpose of code blocks (e.g., paragraphs/sections in COBOL, functions/subroutines), complex logic segments, variable usage (where clarity can be added), or map concepts back to identified business rules or patterns.
*   **FR-LEGACYDOC-005:** If enabled, the system shall generate external documentation files (e.g., in Markdown format) describing the analyzed legacy codebase.
*   **FR-LEGACYDOC-006:** External legacy documentation shall include information such as module/program structure, identified functions/subroutines/paragraphs with their parameters (inferred or explicit), key data structures, call graphs or dependencies, and summaries of inferred logic for complex sections.
*   **FR-LEGACYDOC-007:** The generation of legacy comments and documentation shall utilize configured AI/LLM models (FR-ONPREM-003) to produce natural language explanations based on the IR and analysis results.
*   **FR-LEGACYDOC-008:** The generated commented legacy code copy and the external legacy documentation files shall be stored as distinct artifacts within the project's results in Object Storage.

**3.8 Transformation & Modernization**

CodeRelic shall facilitate running these tests against the translated code within a compatible environment.
*   **FR-FEQ-004:** The system shall offer automated generation of unit test stubs/scaffolding for the translated code (see FR-TEST - now 3.16).
*   **FR-FEQ-005:** The system shall provide functionality to set up, execute, and report on differential testing. This includes:
    *   Allowing definition of input data sets (user-provided or potentially generated via basic strategies).
    *   Providing interfaces for configuring execution environments for both legacy (may require external emulators/interpreters specified by user) and translated code.
    *   Executing both versions with the same inputs within their respective configured environments.
    *   Comparing outputs (stdout, files, database state changes [in isolated test DBs], API responses) based on user-defined criteria and tolerances (e.g., numeric precision).
    *   Reporting comparison results (Pass, Fail, Indeterminate) with details of any mismatches.
*   **FR-FEQ-005.1:** Users shall be responsible for configuring the execution environments (paths to interpreters/emulators, required dependencies) for both legacy and translated code within the testing service's capabilities, and for defining the precise criteria for output equivalence (e.g., file paths to compare, database tables/queries, API endpoints, comparison tolerances).
*   **FR-FEQ-006:** The system shall run configured static analysis tools (linters, formatters specified in FR-CUS-002 - now 3.14) on the generated code and report the results. Integration with external comprehensive static analysis security testing (SAST) tools **[e.g., SonarQube, CodeQL]** may be supported via configuration if available in the environment, but is not a guaranteed built-in feature of V1.

    *   Commented Legacy Code vs. Translated Modern Code (if generated)
*   **FR-DIFF-002:** The view shall support synchronized scrolling between the selected code panels.
*   **FR-DIFF-003:** The view shall highlight changes between the selected code versions (additions, deletions, modifications) at a line or block level.
*   **FR-DIFF-004:** The view shall visually flag or allow filtering/navigation to areas where semantic shifts might have occurred (based on analysis warnings), sections identified as complex, generated documentation (both legacy and modern), or known legacy "quirks" that were handled.
*   **FR-DIFF-005:** The view shall allow navigation linked from analysis warnings or generated comments.
*   **FR-DIFF-006:** The UI shall provide a mechanism to easily view or access the generated external legacy documentation (FR-LEGACYDOC-005) in context while reviewing code (e.g., in a separate panel or via links).

**3.13 Version-Aware Modernization**
*   **FR-VER-001:** The system shall specifically handle intra-language upgrades (initially Python 2 -> Python 3). Support for other upgrades (e.g., older Java -> newer Java) depends on future language support.
*   **FR-VER-002:** The system shall identify usage of deprecated APIs, libraries, or language patterns based on its Knowledge Base for the specific versions involved.
*   **FR-VER-003:** The system shall replace identified deprecated elements with their modern equivalents according to best practices derived from official migration guides stored in the Knowledge Base.
*   **FR-VER-004:** The Knowledge Base for version upgrades shall be maintainable and updatable as part of system maintenance.

**3.14 Customization Engine**
*   **FR-CUS-001:** Users shall be able to configure target language coding style preferences where applicable and supported by the generator (e.g., Object-Oriented vs. Functional emphasis if choices exist).
*   **FR-CUS-002:** Users shall be able to specify standard linters and formatters (e.g., Black, isort for Python; gofmt, golint for Go; Prettier, ESLint for TypeScript) to be applied to the generated code, assuming these tools are available in the execution environment.
*   **FR-CUS-003:** Users shall be able to guide the choice of specific libraries or frameworks in the target language where the system offers known alternatives (e.g., prefer `requests` vs `urllib` in Python for HTTP calls).
*   **FR-CUS-004:** Users shall be able to define aspects of the output project structure (e.g., basic directory layout conventions).
*   **FR-CUS-005:** The system may allow advanced users to define custom transformation rules via a specified format (e.g., configuration files) [Advanced Feature - V1 Scope TBD].

**3.15 Flexible Export Options**
*   **FR-EXP-001:** Users shall be able to download the *translated modern code* as a structured project archive (e.g., .zip) containing source files and potentially configuration.

*   **EI-UI-003:** The UI shall provide mechanisms within the results view to access and display/download the generated legacy documentation artifacts (commented legacy code, external documentation files) (FR-LEGACYDOC-008, FR-DIFF-006).
**4.2 Software Interfaces**

*   **EI-SW-001:** The frontend SPA shall communicate with the backend microservices exclusively via a central API Gateway using a RESTful API over HTTPS. API requests shall be authenticated (e.g., using JWTs obtained via OIDC/SAML flows or session tokens). The API definition will be documented using OpenAPI v3.
*   **EI-SW-002:** The Source Code Ingestion service shall interface with Git repositories via standard protocols (HTTPS, SSH). Necessary credentials/keys must be securely managed.
*   **EI-SW-003:** The system shall interface with configured local LLM endpoints via their specified APIs (expected to be HTTP/S RESTful APIs). Interface details (authentication, request/response format) depend on the specific LLM service used.
*   **EI-SW-004:** The system shall interface with external dependency services using standard clients/protocols:
    *   PostgreSQL Database: via standard SQL client libraries over TCP/IP (TLS recommended).
    *   RabbitMQ/Kafka: via AMQP or Kafka client libraries (TLS recommended).
    *   S3-Compatible Object Storage: via standard S3 SDK/API over HTTPS.
*   **EI-SW-005:** The system's Testing & Validation Service may need to interface with external legacy code execution environments (e.g., specific COBOL runtime emulators, specific Perl interpreter versions) configured by the user for differential testing. The exact interface mechanism (e.g., executing a command within a specified container image, calling a local script) will depend on the nature of the external environment and must be defined during detailed design and documented for user configuration. CodeRelic provides the orchestration and comparison framework, but relies on the user-configured external environment for legacy execution itself.

**4.3 Hardware Interfaces**

*   **EI-HW-001:** No specific hardware interfaces are defined beyond the standard server hardware (CPU - typically x86_64, Memory, Network Interface Cards, Storage) required to run the Kubernetes cluster and associated storage/networking infrastructure meeting the defined NFRs.

**4.4 Communications Interfaces**

*   **EI-COM-006:** The UI shall use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for receiving real-time asynchronous notifications from the backend (e.g., job status updates, completion alerts).

---

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

*Note: Many NFRs contain placeholders (e.g., `[Target: ...]`, `[e.g., ...]`) for specific metrics or configurations. These values must be finalized and agreed upon during the detailed design phase based on stakeholder agreement, target use cases, and technical feasibility analysis. They serve as measurable criteria for acceptance testing.*

*Note on Legacy Documentation Feature: Enabling the optional Legacy Code Documentation Generation feature (Section 3.7) involves additional analysis and AI/LLM processing. This may impact overall project processing time and resource consumption compared to running only the translation pipeline. Performance targets, particularly NFR-PERF-002, should be evaluated both with and without this feature enabled during testing and characterization.*

**5.1 Performance**

*   **NFR-PERF-001:** Interactive UI operations (e.g., navigation, opening dialogs, submitting forms) shall generally complete within **[Target: < 2 seconds for 95th percentile]** under nominal load conditions (see NFR-SCAL-001).

Baselines for different languages/sizes and with legacy documentation enabled to be established.
*   **NFR-PERF-003:** The system shall be optimized to minimize idle resource consumption (CPU, Memory) when no active processing jobs are running.
*   **NFR-PERF-004:** LLM inference calls for documentation generation (both legacy and modern) should be implemented with appropriate timeouts **[Timeout TBD: e.g., 30 seconds per call]** and potentially asynchronous batching to avoid disproportionately delaying the overall pipeline.

**5.2 Scalability**

*   **NFR-SCAL-001:** The system shall support **[Target: 50]** concurrent active users performing typical UI operations (project config, browsing results, viewing dashboards).
*   **NFR-SCAL-002:** The system backend shall support processing **[Target: 10]** concurrent modernization jobs (including optional legacy documentation) of moderate size (e.g., ~100k LOC each) on appropriately scaled infrastructure.
*   **NFR-SCAL-003:** Key backend microservices (specifically Parsing, Analysis, **Legacy/Modern Documentation Generation**, Transformation, Generation, Testing workers) shall be designed stateless where possible and support horizontal scaling via Kubernetes HPA based on configurable metrics (e.g., message queue length, CPU/memory utilization).
*   **NFR-SCAL-004:** The system architecture shall be designed to handle large codebases up to **[Target Upper Bound: e.g., 5 Million LOC]**, although processing time and resource requirements will scale accordingly and require significant infrastructure. Performance expectations for very large codebases must be characterized separately.
*   **NFR-SCAL-005:** The chosen database (PostgreSQL) and message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) solutions must support configurations that allow scaling to meet the anticipated load defined by NFR-SCAL-001 and NFR-SCAL-002.

**5.3 Security**

*   **NFR-SEC-003:** Sensitive configuration data (database passwords, API keys/tokens, Git credentials, LLM keys) MUST be stored securely using mechanisms like Kubernetes Secrets or an integrated Vault, and MUST NOT be stored in plaintext configuration files, logs, or source code.
*   **NFR-SEC-004:** The system shall support deployment configurations where data at rest (object storage artifacts, database volumes/backups) is encrypted. This typically relies on encryption features provided by the underlying storage systems or Kubernetes infrastructure (e.g., encrypted cloud storage volumes, database Transparent Data Encryption - TDE), which must be enabled and configured by the administrator as documented.
*   **NFR-SEC-005:** The system's software supply chain shall be secured via regular dependency scanning using industry-standard tools **[Tools: e.g., Trivy, OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk]** integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. A policy for addressing discovered vulnerabilities must be defined **[Policy: e.g., Critical/High vulnerabilities must be addressed before release or have a documented mitigation plan]**.
*   **NFR-SEC-006:** Container images shall be built using minimal, hardened base images and scanned for OS-level vulnerabilities. Containers shall be configured to run with the minimum necessary privileges (e.g., non-root users where feasible). Kubernetes security contexts shall be applied.
*   **NFR-SEC-007:** Robust input validation shall be implemented on all external interfaces (API Gateway endpoints, UI forms) to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting - XSS, SQL Injection - SQLi, Command Injection). Use of standard libraries/frameworks for input sanitization is required.

*   **NFR-REL-003:** A mechanism for handling irrecoverable task failures shall be implemented, such as moving failed messages to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) with sufficient context for later investigation by administrators. The system should report such failures.
*   **NFR-REL-004:** The system shall perform graceful error handling and provide informative error messages to the user via the UI or to system logs, rather than crashing or returning cryptic errors. Critical backend service failures should not cascade to cause complete UI unavailability if avoidable.
*   **NFR-REL-005:** Database schema migrations required for system upgrades must be handled reliably using established tools (e.g., Alembic for Python/SQLAlchemy) and include procedures for testing migrations and potentially rolling back in case of failure.

*   **NFR-MAIN-005:** The system shall implement comprehensive logging across all microservices using a structured format (e.g., JSON). Log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) shall be configurable dynamically or at deployment time. Logs should be easily collectable by standard aggregation tools (e.g., EFK/Loki stack).
*   **NFR-MAIN-006:** All backend microservices shall expose standardized health check endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`) for monitoring by Kubernetes probes and external monitoring systems.
*   **NFR-MAIN-007:** The build, testing, and deployment process for CodeRelic components shall be fully automated via CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).

*   **OR-LIC-002:** The system must track and comply with the licenses of all included third-party libraries (Open Source or otherwise). A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) shall be generated as part of the build process and potentially made available to customers. License compliance checks should be part of the development process.

**6.3 Regulatory Compliance**

*   **OR-REG-001:** While CodeRelic processes source code which may be sensitive, it does not inherently store or process regulated data such as PII or PHI unless such data is embedded directly within the source code itself. Its on-premise design (CST-01, CST-02) aims to facilitate use by customers in regulated environments (e.g., Finance/HIPAA). Customers remain responsible for ensuring their specific use case, data handling, and overall environment complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA). The system's features (e.g., RBAC, audit logs) should support, not hinder, customer compliance efforts.
