# CodeRelic

Welcome to the central documentation repository for the **CodeRelic** project.

## Project Introduction

CodeRelic is an AI-driven software platform addressing the significant challenges posed by legacy codebases within enterprises. Many critical systems rely on outdated technologies (like COBOL, Perl, Python 2) which are costly to maintain, difficult to update, present security risks, and hinder innovation. CodeRelic tackles this problem by providing an automated solution to translate these legacy systems into modern, maintainable languages (such as Python 3, Go, TypeScript, Rust). It focuses on preserving the core business logic embedded within the original code while significantly improving its structure, readability, documentation, and testability, ultimately enabling organizations to revitalize their essential software assets.

## The Vision

To empower organizations worldwide to seamlessly evolve their critical software infrastructure, eliminating the barriers imposed by outdated technology and unlocking the full potential for innovation trapped within legacy systems. We envision a future where modernizing essential codebases is no longer a high-risk, multi-year endeavor, but an accessible and continuous part of the software lifecycle.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as the single source of truth for all official documentation related to the CodeRelic project. It contains specifications, design documents, operational guides, user manuals, development process guidelines, and other essential project artifacts. It is intended for use by all project stakeholders, including developers, architects, QA engineers, DevOps personnel, project managers, security teams, and end-user administrators.
