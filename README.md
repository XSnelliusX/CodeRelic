# CodeRelic

Welcome to the central documentation repository for the **CodeRelic** project.

## Project Introduction

CodeRelic is an AI-driven software platform addressing the significant challenges posed by legacy codebases within enterprises. Many critical systems rely on outdated technologies (like COBOL, Perl, Python 2) which are costly to maintain, difficult to update, present security risks, and hinder innovation. CodeRelic tackles this problem by providing an automated solution to translate these legacy systems into modern, maintainable languages (such as Python 3, Go, TypeScript, Rust). It focuses on preserving the core business logic embedded within the original code while significantly improving its structure, readability, documentation, and testability, ultimately enabling organizations to revitalize their essential software assets.

## The Vision

To empower organizations worldwide to seamlessly evolve their critical software infrastructure, eliminating the barriers imposed by outdated technology and unlocking the full potential for innovation trapped within legacy systems. We envision a future where modernizing essential codebases is no longer a high-risk, multi-year endeavor, but an accessible and continuous part of the software lifecycle.

## The Mission

To provide a secure, intelligent, and reliable platform that accurately translates and modernizes legacy codebases through advanced AI. We are committed to ensuring functional equivalence, enhancing code quality, and empowering development teams with comprehensive tools and insights, thereby reducing technical debt, mitigating security risks, and accelerating the delivery of value from critical software systems. Our mission is achieved by focusing on robust on-premise deployment, meticulous validation strategies, and continuous improvement driven by user needs and technological advancements.
